# Advanced TimeWarp Trigger

Advanced TimeWarp Trigger enhances the standard timewarp functionality in Geometry Dash by allowing multiple individual timewarp triggers to be placed in sequence, simulating smooth easing effects. Instead of instantly jumping from one speed to another (e.g., from 1.0 to 0.5), Advanced TimeWarp gradually transitions through intermediate values like: e.g. 1.0, 0.98, 0.96, ..., 0.5, creating a fluid and visually appealing slowdown or speed-up.

The mod supports both linear transitions and the built-in easing equations already present in Geometry Dash, giving creators precise control over how timewarp effects accelerate or decelerate throughout a level.

I had to create this mod because Rob didn't include this feature in the TimeWarp trigger.
